# Project-PersonaMediaVault

Welcome to **Project-PersonaMediaVault**! This project focuses on creating a sophisticated media management system that leverages face detection and web crawling technologies to group and organize media collections by persona. **Project-PersonaMediaVault** uses AI to identify and group media files based on the faces and personas depicted, and it automates the discovery of related media across the web.

## Project Overview

**Project-PersonaMediaVault** is designed to enhance media management by automatically grouping and organizing media collections based on the personas present in the content. The system utilizes advanced face detection technology and web scraping bots to identify personas, categorize media, and discover additional related media online.

## Features

### Persona Identification and Grouping

- **Face Detection:** Automatically detect and recognize faces in media files using advanced AI models.
- **Persona Grouping:** Organize media collections into groups based on identified personas and their attributes.
- **Metadata Enrichment:** Enrich media metadata with persona information to facilitate better organization and retrieval.

### Web Crawling and Media Discovery

- **Automated Web Crawling:** Use bots to search the web for additional media related to identified personas.
- **Media Aggregation:** Gather and integrate new media into existing collections based on persona relevance.
- **Update Notifications:** Receive notifications when new related media is discovered and added to the vault.

### Advanced Search and Retrieval

- **Persona-Based Search:** Search for media based on personas, attributes, and related criteria.
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Filter and sort media collections based on various attributes and metadata.

### Customization and Integration

- **Customizable Detection Models:** Configure and train face detection models to improve accuracy and adaptability.
- **API Integration:** Integrate with other media management systems and tools using provided APIs.

## Architecture

**Project-PersonaMediaVault** utilizes a combination of AI, web scraping, and modern architecture to deliver its features:

- **Face Detection and Recognition:** Employ AI models and libraries (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow) for face detection and persona recognition.
- **Web Crawling Bots:** Use web scraping frameworks (e.g., Scrapy, BeautifulSoup) to search and collect related media from the web.
- **Serverless Functions:** Deploy serverless functions (e.g., Azure Functions) for scalable processing and automation.
- **Database Management:** Store and manage media metadata and persona information using a robust database system (e.g., PostgreSQL).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org) (version 3.7 or higher) for running scripts and applications.
- [Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com) for deploying serverless functions (optional).
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for containerization and deployment.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for development tools and libraries.
